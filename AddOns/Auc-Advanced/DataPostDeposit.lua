	This is an addon for World of Warcraft that adds statistical history to the auction data that is collected
	when the auction is scanned, so that you can easily determine what price
	you will be able to sell an item for at auction or at a vendor whenever you
	mouse-over an item in the game

	Install Deposit Cost special data to the core AucAdvanced.Data table

	Deposit Cost for certain TradeSkill reagents has an extra fee (intended as a deterrent to selling lots of small stacks)
	Affected items broadly follow some rules, i.e. tradeskill items in certain classes
	However there are a number of exceptions that must be maintained as a database

	Implemented as a separate file containg raw data, for ease of maintenance
	Auctioneer modules will normally compile the raw data into a more useable format, {usually during "gameactive" event - NYI}
