## Dominos is an action bar addon intended to do the following:

* Reuse as much standard blizzard action button code as possible.
* Contain a relatively minimal feature set
* Be easy to use
* Be stable

## It includes the following features:

* 10 action bars, pet, class, menu, and bag bars. Each one has customizable settings for padding, spacing, columns, scale, and opacity.
* Customizable paging. You can switch pages on: action bar pages, modifier keys, forms, and targeting.
* Customizable show states. You can tell your bar under which macro options to show.
* Fading bars. You can set your bars to fade out to a certain opacity when not moused over.
* The ability to customize showing empty buttons or not
* Full button facade support
* Keybound support
* Sticky frames
* The ability to move buttons in combat
* A movable casting bar (optional)
* A movable roll frame (optional)
* A movable xp/reputation bar (optional)
* Configurable right click targeting
* Configurable self cast key settings
* Possess bar support

## ...and will probably not end up with the following:

* A stats bar
* A minimap bar
* True variable length bars

## Here's how you use it:

* To see the current list of slash commands, type /dom ? or /dominos ?
* To open up the options menu, either go into interface options, or type /dom
* To move bars around, either go into the options menu and press the "Enter Config Mode" button, or type /dom config
* To bind keys, enter binding mode via /kb or /keybound, or press the "Enter Binding Mode" button in the options menu.
