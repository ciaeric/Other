## Install

Installing directly from source is not guaranteed to work. You should download a packaged version here instead:

- [CurseForge Download.](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccastbars)
- [WoWInterface Download.](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info24925-ClassicCastbars.html)
- [Github Download](https://github.com/wardz/classiccastbars/releases) (Choose binary instead of source code)

## Configuration

Type `/castbar` or go to `Escape -> Interface Options -> AddOns -> ClassicCastbars` to open the options panel.  
Feel free to request new options, however, I want this addon to remain as lightweight and blizz-like as possible so I won't
add any major things like custom animations, alerts, latency indicator and so on.

  When forking the addon you should save the folder somewhere outside your WoW AddOns directory and  
  instead have two symlinks inside the AddOns folder pointing to
  `ClassicCastbars/ClassicCastbars/` and `ClassicCastbars/ClassicCastbars_Options/`.
